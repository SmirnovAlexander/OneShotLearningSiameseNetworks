# Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition
 
 This repo contains implementation of [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf).
 
 Also [this blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/one-shot-learning-with-siamese-networks-using-keras-17f34e75bb3d) was used for a better understanding.
 
 [Here](/papers/OneShotLearningSiameseNetworks%20-%20slides.pdf) is brief overview of what had been done in this paper.
 
 [Here](/notebooks/OneShotLearningSiameseNetwork.ipynb) is an implementation of this algorithm.
